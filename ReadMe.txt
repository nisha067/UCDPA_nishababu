Note: Since the input dataset is 450MB even after compressing it goes beyond 100MB. So i am not adding input file in the current archieve file. 
	  Please download the source dataset from Kaggle as defined in the project report or you can use "https://www.kaggle.com/rounak041993/traffic-violations-in-maryland-county" and place it under your project. So that code can read the data set.

Due to the size restriction not all the libraries are included part of the report. So you can install required pip libraries to execute the program.
Addition to default python library one might need to add the below list to their repositry to run the program.

Package Name - Version - Author
pandas - 1.3.5 - The Pandas Development Team
requests - 2.27.1 - Kenneth Reitz
seaborn - 0.11.2 - michael waskom
